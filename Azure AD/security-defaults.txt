How to Enable Security Defaults: ( Free Feature )

-> Go to Azure AD > Properties > Manage Security Defaults.

Toggle Enable Security Defaults to "Yes" and save.

Key Features of Security Defaults:

> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):

Enforces MFA for all users, especially administrators and privileged roles, 
helping to prevent unauthorized access in case of compromised credentials.
Users are required to register for MFA, which typically involves the Microsoft Authenticator app
or phone-based verification.

> Blocking Legacy Authentication:

Disables access from legacy authentication protocols (like POP, IMAP, SMTP) that donâ€™t support MFA.
Legacy authentication is more vulnerable to attacks 
and is often used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to accounts.

> Administrator Protection:

Applies stricter policies to administrator accounts by requiring MFA 
and ensuring these accounts are protected with additional layers of security.

> User Registration for MFA:

Encourages or enforces all users to set up MFA during their first sign-in, 
ensuring that even if the organization grows, new users are secured.

> Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR):

For organizations with Azure AD Premium licenses, 
Security Defaults can help enforce SSPR for enhanced user self-management.
