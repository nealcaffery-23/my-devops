> How to Create a Conditional Access Policy

> Sign in to the Azure AD portal.

Go to Security > Conditional Access.

> Select New Policy, name your policy, 
and configure the Assignments (e.g., users, applications, conditions).

> Under Access Controls, configure Grant or Session controls.

> Enable the Policy: 

Make sure to test policies before full deployment, especially if they could impact critical applications or large groups.
Considerations

> Licensing: 

Conditional Access requires Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 licenses, 
with advanced risk-based controls available in P2.

> Testing Policies: 

Improperly configured policies can inadvertently lock users out, so testing is crucial.

> Monitoring and Insights: 

Regularly monitor the impact of Conditional Access policies with sign-in logs and reports to fine-tune settings.
